    "### Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency designed to act as a form of legal tender in financial transactions, eliminating the need for third party individuals. To purchase bitcoins, most people do not purchase it in its entirety but rather small portions since there is a risk to buying them. After purchasing bitcoins, you will need to obtain a cryptocurrency wallet. The wallet will contain private keys to the bitcoins that you own and each time you conduct a transaction they will ask the user to enter the keys. "
